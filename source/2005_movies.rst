2005 Movie Reviews
==================

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
`````````````````````````````````
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory centers on little
Charlie Buckett (Freddie Highmore) who wins the chance
to tour Mr. Wonka’s (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory by
finding a golden ticket. Charlie takes the tour with his
grandfather and 4 other children and their guardians as
well. Many feel Johnny Depp made a mistake with how he
played Mr. Wonka as a mysterious character, while the
movie is really focused on Charlie. Still the movie
manages to succeed even with the mistakes and holes found
throughout.

magic and talking animals.

Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest

Jack Sparrow(Johnny Depp) is once again back with his
notorious humor and bizzare plans. In Pirates of the
Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest Jack owes Davy Jones

fight off the other parties interested in the heart of
Davy Jones for their own agendas. To do this he will
need to enlist and save his old partners in crime

Cars
`````
Owen Wilson stars in the children's movie hit Cars.
Owen Wilson plays the part of Lightning McQueen who is
a famous racer. While on his way to race against The
King(Richard Petty) and Chick Hicks(Michael keaton)
McQueen damages the road of Radiator Springs and is
sentenced to repair the road. Children watching Cars
will find themselves caught up in the story of
Lightning McQueen as he makes new friends and finds
love. A must watch for children.

300
````
Arguable the most famous military operation ever
carried out was by King Leonidas, his 300 soldiers,
and an assortment of other greek-city-states warriors
as they fought to hold the Persian army at the pass of
Thermopylae, otherwise known as the “Hot Gates”. Gerard
Butler plays King Leonidas exceptionally well in the
film. Gerard Butler truly plays the character of King
Leonidas as a man willing to sacrifice anything and
everything to stop the Persians from invading and
conquering the greek states. 300 is truly a must watch
for those who enjoy the historical action films,
but be warned the film is very gory and features many
bloody scenes.

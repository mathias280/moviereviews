==================

Bridge to Terabithia
`````````````````````
Sean Aarons(Josh Hutcherson) has his dreams
of being the fastest runner at his school dashed
by the new girl at school. Leslie Burke(AnnaSophia Robb)
is the exact opposite of Sean and yet the two become fast
friends and together they create the fantasy world of **Terabithia**,
a magical land filled with all sorts of magical creatures and
together the pair rule as king and queen. Much like the film
Spiderwick the film makes it very easy for young kids to get
lost in a magical world. They will find humor and sadness and
will surely enjoy the film.

Arcades characters come to life after the arcade closes.
Wreck-It Ralph is an emotionally disturb character that
goes on a quest for a "Gold Medal" because he wants to
accepted by the building people and have someone to talk
to. When Ralph decides to go on his quest, he leaves his
game in search of his medal. This spells bad news for
the building people and Fix-it Flex. With Ralph gone
the arcade own has no choice but to label the machine
broken.

Ralph is found missing after one night at "Tappers."
Ralph trades places with a soldier from *Hero's Duty*
a game of first shooter action, but when Ralph takes
the Hero's medal, he unleashes a swarm of evil bugs that
threaten the arcade.

After crashing into *Sugar Rush* Ralph finds an annoying
unlikely friend, Penelope Von Sweets. A sweet girl that
just wants to race, and when she takes Ralph medal she
uses it for an enter fee to a big race.

As the friendship builds, Ralph realizes that Penelope
is just like him. Forced to live out in an unfinished
bonus section of the game like Ralph in the waste of the
bricks, but Penelope is much more to her game. Locked
away from everyone memory is Penelope's identity of
queen of *Sugar Rush*.

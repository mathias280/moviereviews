We have chosen *Ender's Game* for our review.



Ender's Game
------------

In the 2013 movie, *Ender's Game* you might notice a
similar plot as in the popular cult film *Starship
Troopers* of 1997. In both movies the main plot is
kill an insect looking alien that has threaten human
extinction.

There are some major differences between these to moves
such as:

   #.  Ender's Game is not at constant war with the alien
       species. There have been years that have passed.
       The final battle is to prevent the alien species
       from ever attacking again. Whereas
       Starship Troopers is constantly battling
       their alien adversary.

   #. In Ender's Game, Ender after destroying the home
      planet of the alien enemy joins with the queen of
      the aliens to help her find colonies of her alien
      species. But, in Starship Troopers the queen is
      captured to be used in controlling the alien species.

   #. The main weapon in Ender's Game is a big cannon on
      the flag ship that delivers a blast strong enough
      to annihilate a single planet. Starship Troopers
      weapon is a nuclear bomb delivered at the center of
      the alien nest.

So, you can see the strong resemblance
to the earlier movie *Starship Troopers* as far as
the plot, but with some differences.

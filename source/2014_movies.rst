   Guardians of the Galaxy [#f1]_

The Guardians of the Galaxy is one of the Marvel
comics. It does not have the popularity of the more
famous Spider-Man, X-Men, and Avengers.
But regardless of its little fame,
Guardians of the Galaxy popularity grew when the comic
hit the theaters.

**The main characters**

   * *Chris Pratt* that plays Star Lord was raised by Yondu
     as a bounty-hunter after his mother dies, but at some
     point Peter Quill becomes an adult and finds himself
     making new friends out of a bunch of misfits.

   * *Bradley Cooper* voices the gun-slinging raccoon
     that has some resentments toward the humankind. Rocket
     love to show humor by mouthing off to his fellow
     guardians. Rocket is always found next to the walking
     tree. Yes! It is "Groot." Vin Diesel voices the 10 foot
     tall tree like character who is loving and kind. Diesel
     did not have many lines to remember as for his character
     communicates "I am Groot!"

   * Gamora is a green-skinned assassin that is a run away
     from her family that is the villains in this movie. She
     has sibling rivalry and is the good looking seductive
     *Zoe Saldana* role Character.

   * WWE super star *Dave Bautista* that plays the
     tattooed bulk of muscle looking for revenge for the
     death of his family. Raw locked up rage gives this
     character an attitude toward Gamora and her father Raonan.

This band of misfits help save the galaxy from a great
power that fell into the wrong hands. Star Lord with the
help of his friends exsorb this power in a highly computer
genterated graphic explosion that elimenates the hostel
threat.

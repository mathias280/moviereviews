grandfather's death.
This twisted relationship brings Kylo to the right
of passage with the dark side by the death
of his father Han Solo.

The Death Star plans have been innovated
to a death planet type system. A planet that has
a weapon far greater than that of the Death Star.

a nearby sun, stores the energy in its main reactors,
and releases it on targeted planet systems
that oppose the New Order.

can destroy multiple planets with a single blast.

Solo, and Chewbacca and meet Kylo Ren in an epic battle

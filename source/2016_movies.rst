War Dogs
---------

With the war in Iraq raging on, a young man (Jonah Hill) offers his childhood
friend a chance to make big bucks by becoming an international arms dealer.
Together, they exploit a government initiative that allows businesses to bid
on U.S. military contracts. Starting small allows the duo to rake in money and
live the high life. They soon find themselves in over their heads after landing
a $300 million deal to supply Afghan forces, a deal that puts them in business
with some very shady people.

Based on true events, this movie is very interesting. Jonah Hill and Miles
Teller plays the parts in this movie very well. The contracts that the two get
into take them to the far corners of the world and allow them to experience a life
they never though out. Overall a very engaging film and worth the watch.

Hell or High Water
-------------------

Toby is a divorced father who's trying to make a better life for his son. His brother
Tanner is an ex-convict with a short temper and a loose trigger finger. Together,
they plan a series of heists against the bank that's about to foreclose on their
family ranch. Standing in their way is Marcus, a Texas Ranger who's only weeks away
from retirement. As the siblings plot their final robbery, they must also prepare for
a showdown with a crafty lawman who's not ready to ride off into the sunset.

The film portrays some very real yet frightening events that could take place in
America today. Taking place in Texas, the movie shows actions taken by an economically
depressed family. The movie is interesting in the way the brothers go about making hits
on these banks. The brothers are radical and are willing to kill to get paid, which is why
this movie will keep you engaged the whole time!

Split
------

Though Kevin (James McAvoy) has evidenced 23 personalities to his trusted psychiatrist,
Dr. Fletcher, there remains one still submerged who is set to materialize and dominate a
ll of the others, the beast. Compelled to abduct three teenage girls led by the willful,
observant Casey, Kevin reaches a war for survival among all of those contained within him
-- as well as everyone around him -- as the walls between his compartments shatter.

This movie is fascinating simply because of the condition Kevin is in. McAvoy plays
the part like a natural, casually switching between the personalities. Learning how
serious his multiple personalities disorder is, is what will keep you engaged. It is a true
testament to the power of the mind. One personality can be blind or allergic to bees for
example, while the others arent. Kevin constantly refers to the beast and the sacrifices
that must take place. Working up to his eventual reveal will keep you laser focused!

Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates
---------------------------------

Mike and Dave Stangle are young, adventurous, fun-loving brothers who tend to get out of
control at family gatherings. When their sister Jeanie reveals her Hawaiian wedding plans,
the rest of the clan insists that they both bring respectable dates to keep them in check.
After placing an ad on Craigslist, the siblings decide to pick Tatiana and Alice, two charming
and seemingly normal women. Once they arrive on the island, Mike and Dave realize that their
companions are ready to get wild and party hard, only joining them for the free trip.

This movie is absolutely hilarious! Adam Devine and Zac Efron play the parts of Mike and Dave
as if they were actually brothers. The movie is full of one-liners that will have you rolling.
Along with that, the movie actually has a decent plot. If you are looking for some good laughs
and entertainment, this is the movie for you!

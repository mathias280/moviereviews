Star Wars: The Force Awakens (Sci-Fi Action)
--------------------------------------------

 Thirty Years Later!

Thirty years of waiting brings
the 7th episode in the Star Wars series.
J.J. Abrahms, brings forth the "New Order" as the
predecessor of the old Empire order.
The character Kylo Ren  is the rebellious
offspring of Han Solo and Leia. Kylo, has serious
"Daddy issues" and turns to the darkside as a act
of abandenment by his father.
He idolizes his grandfather (on his mother's side)
Darth Vader and wants to  avenge his
grandfather's death.
This twisted relationship brings Kylo to the right
of passage with the darkside by the death
of his father Han Solo.

The Death Star plans have been innovated
to a death planet type system. A planet that has
a weapon far greater than that of the Death Star.
The weapon harnesses the energy of
a nearby sun, stores the energy in its main reactors,
and releases it on targeted planet systems
that oppose the New Order.
It the typical purpose like the Death Stars
main weapon, but the death planet weapon
can destroy multiple planets with a single blast.

You will recognize the familar faces of the
original Star Wars charactors such as
Chewbacca, Han Solo, Princess Leia,
and Luke Skywalker. You will also be introduced
to new charactors such as Kylo Ren, Rey, BB-8,
Finn, storm troopers, and Poe.
Although some of the crafts look different
you will still get to see the
Millennium Falcon, tie fighters, and Star Destroyers.
